# HandSpeak: Real-Time ASL Detection to OBS Virtual Camera via NDI

This project streams ASL hand detection output directly to OBS using NDI and MediaPipe Hands.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gamerwaves/HandSpeak.git
cd HandSpeak
```

---

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

> **Note:**  
> If you're not using bash, the activation command may vary.

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Download and Install OBS Studio

- Download the latest version of OBS Studio from [https://obsproject.com/download](https://obsproject.com/download)

---

### 5. Download the DistroAV Plugin

- Download from: [https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/distroav-network-audio-video-in-obs-studio-using-ndiÂ®-technology.528/](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/distroav-network-audio-video-in-obs-studio-using-ndiÂ®-technology.528/)
- DistroAV is a lightweight NDI display/preview and routing tool.
- Use the installation instructions on the download page for your os.

> **Note:**  
> On Linux, you also need to install **ndi-sdk** using your distribution's package manager.

---

### 6. Run the Detection Script

```bash
python main/detect.py
```

This will start MediaPipe hand tracking and send frames over NDI.

---

### 7. Add NDI Source in OBS

- In OBS, click the **âž• (plus)** button under *Sources*.
- Select **NDI Source**.
- Click the small **dropdown arrow** beside the source name.
- Select the NDI stream titled `ASL-Detection-NDI`.

---

### 8. Start OBS Virtual Camera

- Click **Start Virtual Camera** in OBS.
- You can now use this virtual camera in Zoom, Google Meet, Discord, etc.

---

## âœ… Notes

- Make sure OBS and the Python script are on the same network (localhost is fine).
- DistroAV requires the latest OBS version for it to work properly.
